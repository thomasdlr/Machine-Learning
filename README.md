# Machine-Learning

These folders regroups the 7 practical works of the Machine Learning course I attended in NCTU, Taiwan in Fall/Winter 2019.
For every homework, you will find a pdf describing the instructions, and one or several python file that regroups my work for the given homework.
You will sometimes find a file containing the used data. 

Please note that these works were achieved in 2019 and that my coding practices have evolved.
